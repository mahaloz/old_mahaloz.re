excerpt: "Who the hell is mahaloz?"
---
Hi, I'm [Zion Basque](https://zionbasque.com) a native Hawaiian hacker, 
better known as mahaloz. I'm a [ctf](https://ctftime.org/about/) player 
with [@Shellphish](https://twitter.com/shellphish?lang=en) and the
captain of [@pwndevils](https://pwndevils.com/). I love reverse engineering,
pwning, exploration robotics, and computers in general. I also so happen to be a
researcher in the Arizona State University [SEFCOM](https://ctftime.org/about/)
research lab. My research also focuses on reverse engineering, pwning, and
machine learning with respects to fuzzing. My research advisor is the renowned
[Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://www.yancomm.net/).
